# Assignment 2 - Web Development Using HTML, CSS, and SVG

## Overview
This repository contains the submission for **Assignment 2** for CSC317. The project includes a static website built using HTML, CSS, and SVG elements, as well as an SVG animation. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, and all required features have been implemented as specified in the assignment.

## Description of Features

### **Banner**
- **House and Sun Design (index.html)**:  
  The banner at the top of the homepage was created using basic SVG elements. It includes a **house** with windows and a door, along with a **sun** in the sky, giving the page a creative and personalized touch. The house is made using `<rect>` elements for the body and door, and `<polygon>` for the roof. The windows have been styled using `<line>` to create a frame effect, while the sun uses a `<circle>` element with a radial gradient for a smooth, glowing effect.
  
  This SVG banner spans the full width of the screen and is 300px in height, adhering to the assignment requirements.

### **Table (two.html)**:
- A table was created on the second page (`two.html`) to list my top four favorite coding resources, using `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` elements. The table includes four rows and two columns, with the first row acting as a heading. The table is styled with borders and padding for better readability, and the caption is centered above the table.

### **SVG Animation (three.html and page-three.svg)**:
- On the third page (`three.html`), an SVG animation was created featuring a small red circle traversing the perimeter of a square. This animation demonstrates the use of the `<animateMotion>` element in SVGs, where the circle follows a path defined by the `<path>` element. The animation file (`page-three.svg`) is stored in the `resources/` folder and is displayed using an `<img>` tag in the HTML file.
  
  The animation visually showcases the capabilities of SVG for dynamic graphics, fulfilling the assignmentâ€™s requirement for an animated SVG.
  
### **Bonus CSS Features**
- The custom CSS styling includes additional features such as:
  - **Google Fonts Integration**: The website uses the **'Inter'** font, which enhances the readability and aesthetics of the page.
  - **Navigation Bar Styling**: A responsive navigation menu with hover effects has been created. When users hover over the links, they turn yellow and are underlined.
  - **Footer**: A sticky footer has been implemented, which stays at the bottom of the page.
  These features, although not required, improve the overall user experience and were added as bonus improvements.
